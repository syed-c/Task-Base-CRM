## 🚀 Deployment Steps for Hostinger

### 1. Build Your Static Site

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Upload to Hostinger

1. **Login to Hostinger** control panel
2. **Go to File Manager** or use FTP
3. **Navigate to** `public_html` folder
4. **Upload all contents** from the `out/` folder to `public_html`

### 3. File Structure on Hostinger

```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── 404.html
├── _next/
│   ├── static/
│   └── jW_G_GWEFnQqyzr7vtB/
└── [other static files]
```

### 4. Configure Domain

- Point your domain to the hosting
- The site will be available at `yourdomain.com`

## 🔧 Making Chat Real-time (Optional)

If you want real-time chat functionality, you have two options:

### Option 1: Separate WebSocket Server

1. **Deploy WebSocket server** to a Node.js hosting service (Railway, Render, etc.)
2. **Update environment variables** in your static site
3. **Connect to external WebSocket server**

### Option 2: Use External Chat Service

- **Firebase Realtime Database**
- **Supabase Realtime**
- **Pusher**
- **Stream Chat**

## 📁 Build Output Location

After running `npm run build`, your static files are in:

```
out/
├── index.html          # Main page
├── 404.html           # Error page
├── _next/             # Next.js assets
│   ├── static/        # CSS, JS, images
│   └── [build-id]/    # Compiled pages

```

## 🎯 What to Upload to Hostinger
